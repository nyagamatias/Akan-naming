            <h1>Akan Naming</h1>
            <p>Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. <br> Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born. <br> Most people do know when their birthdays are, but some might not know what day of the week they were born. <br> Luckily for us, there are ways to calculate the day of the week from a specific date.</p>
